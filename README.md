# NuScenes-MQA

![Sample Annotations](./src/sample_annotations.jpg)

## Abstract
Visual Question Answering (VQA) is one of the most important tasks in autonomous driving, which requires accurate recognition and complex situation evaluations. However, datasets annotated in a QA format, which guarantees precise language generation and scene recognition from driving scenes, have not been established yet. In this work, we introduce Markup-QA, a novel dataset annotation technique in which QAs are enclosed within markups. This approach facilitates the simultaneous evaluation of a model's capabilities in sentence generation and VQA. Moreover, using this annotation methodology, we designed the NuScenes-MQA dataset. This dataset empowers the development of vision language models, especially for autonomous driving tasks, by focusing on both descriptive capabilities and precise QA.
